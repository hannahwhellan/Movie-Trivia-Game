# Movie-Trivia-Game
A trivia game that operates by the program reading in movie scripts and 
uses a decision tree to ask the user questions related to different movie 
genres that the user can then be asked questions about. Questions are 
hardcoded but answers are randomly selected and presented in a multiple 
choice layout. The game keeps track of how many correct questions were 
answered and designates the user with a certain level of movie trivia mastery at the end.
